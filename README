kMoria 0.1
==========

This is Bridget Spitznagel's Mines of Moria roguelike game for PalmOS
/ Palm Pilot. It is derived from Umoria (Unix Moria) 5.5.2. Major
changes include resizing the 80x24 screen down for the smaller screen
size of the Palm Pilots and adapting it to the Graffiti input used by
PalmOS devices.

I've made no changes to this code, I just collected it for reference.
I played this game extensively on a second hand Palm VII in 2000-2001.
