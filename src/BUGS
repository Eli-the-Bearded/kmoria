Bugs in store:
-------------

You can attempt to buy a "..." item and this is not caught
(the description shows up as "error in objdes()" or something)
This is not a problem for the sell command of course.
Ok, I have fixed that.  Tested out ok.  9/29

Hm, seems like scrolling is not working yet.
Ok, I have fixed that.  Tested out ok.  9/29

When you buy something, the store's inventory display does not update.
Ok, sort of fixed.  There's still a bug.  When the last item moves up,
things get screwy.  I will fix this some other day.

"Buying: 20 Rations of Food"
"Buying: 10 Strips of Beef Jerky"
um, try *1*?

Suggestions for store:
---------------------

Perhaps the <- +> should disable themselves when there's < 1 screen of items!!
ok.  still visible but returns w/o redrawing.  9/29
Perhaps there is room for a page number btwn <- and +>.
ok, done.  9/29

Incomplete implementation:
-------------------------
(Selling basically works now)


(Notes:  if ".text" region is full, do not panic;
move stuff out of the default code section into e.g. SEC_4).


Things to do when I have nothing better to do:
------------
add monster_attacks to lock.c !!!!!!  currently it's in recall.c

fix the tiny-print stats for 18/xx stats. currentyl fsked.

all forms need (i) information strings!

"quit" doesn't work

magic.c: cast_helper does not get 'dir' for spells that need it!!
         same for prayer.c and pray_helper
moria4.c: look_see needs frobbing also.

command count.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
I still need an initial "you can gain <foo>s" message when char created!

are mana points being decreased?  YES but:
they're increased when you Gain but it's not showing til next turn. ohwell.

oh, by the way, you don't need a light source in dungeons and all is 'known'!
did I disable something or what?
(interesting you don't run in 'dark' corridors.)

running: leaves a @ drawn at the location where you started running.
	fixed: initialize find_prself to true. (bug in sub3_move_light?)
runfighting doesn't work properly I think.
	actually I think this might be a feature.  "oops"/ow
you're not redrawn when you pick something up?
cool, opening doors works (and closing and off-balance branch of forcing)

unfortunately it is sometimes STILL the case that when you start out
in a new dungeon level it does not draw you at first?

sometimes it locks up, with no error given in simulator or xterm,
after killing e.g. battle-scarred veteran monster which leaves an object.
could be out of memory or who knows what.
it did this when I walked on a potoin or scroll or something; maybe name fscked

Looks like the AC is not changing when I wear armor
need run to *hit* a monster if you *start out* next to it
redrawing screen is SLOW.
"rest" is not actually implemented yet - it's maybe missing some pieces.
