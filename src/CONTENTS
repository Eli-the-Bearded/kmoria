Status and provenance of various files in here.


copyright.txt - waiting til I decide on a name to include this in places.

dbrecords.c - this is a file that will need to be split up
	one half is for a little application to write the "read only" db
	the other half is for reading all dbs and writing some parts of save db
	the two half are totally intermingled
not currently used

dbrecords.h - this documents which routines actually belong to the game
	as opposed to the little db-writing application
not currently used

globals.h - The type definition of the 'everything' struct
	Some things here could be SaveDB records instead!

gzip.txt - some vague notes on packing of data (to keep databases small)

records.h - where to define the constants that are record unique ID's.
	dbrecords.c should #include this
not currently used

These have had indenting (and ansitude of args) cleaned up but that's about it.
	i.e. they need to be databaseified
store1.c
moria4.c  * needs highlight_seams and many functions
let's look at cleaning up: moria3.c

 * the compiler is happy except for missing functions & undeclared globals


things that are used as of july 9...

kMoria.h: what the app id is, etc, and what header files to include

sections.h: for multigen
kMoria.def: for multigen

constant.h - These are #define's of numbers.  (not #define macros)
	I made a first pass on this.
	A few things still need to change or to be removed!!

types.h - type definitions.
	I have been through this once, but it will need more work.
	Especially since I am not exactly going to have "char *"'s
	and therefore all the careful record packing needs fixed.

prototypes.h - function prototypes

records.h - what unique-ids are of the various records

main.c - event handlers etc. are here

display.c - drawing dungeon, stats, messages to the screen

lock.c - create/lock/unlock the database records and _some_ write/read stuff

section1:
misc1.c - has everything original misc1.c did?
	needs a REAL randnor, compact_monsters, compact_objects ...
	'panel' foo needs to be REWORKED and moved to display.c
generate.c - generate level; has everything original generate.c did?
misc2.c - has everything original misc2.c did?
	set_options NEEDS TO BE IMPLEMENTED and should be a popup form
sets.c - 'is-a' functions that could practically be macros.
	all there, I think

misc3.c - SOME MISSING.  some of what's missing belongs in display.c
moria3.c - no functions missing now
recall.c - working! (with form_recall.c)
	I haven't DESIGNED how you would get to this form UI-wise, though.

eat.c - ok, I think
potions.c - ditto
moria2.c - there except for COMMENTED-OUT LINES.  actually, all there?
spells.c - all there except for (many) COMMENTED-OUT LINES.  yep still.
misc4.c - here too there are COMMENTED-OUT LINES.  yep still.
staffs.c - sorta all there but needs direction foo
wands.c - sorta all there but needs direction foo
magic.c - all there except for several COMMENTED-OUT LINES.  yep still.
prayer.c - all there except for several COMMENTED-OUT LINES (same as magic.c)
moria4.c - all there except for several COMMENTED-OUT LINES (different)

what shall I work on?...................................................

things that MUST be changed for DmWrite:  enchant() --- Done, 10/5
also vaguely working on getting eat.c to compile.  OK
Character Generation!  It is (for the most part) WORKING.
  Check later and see if I have forgotten anything though.
  I need py.* save and restore (for ungenerated)
  I need magic_init (for both!?)
inventory/equipment are viewable.
wear/wield, take off, drop basically work

To do: add mushrooms, etc., in lock.c and in the MoriaDB.

regressive testing:
have I tested unsample?  I suspect it is buggy.

to steal from iLarn:  '--more--' ability

** End of september: **
Worked on store2.c.  it's all there now, just a tad buggy in places.
I have processed creature.c and it compiles.  untested of course.

things that are not implemented yet:  move_char (moria3),
would be used in spells.c - prt_map, put_qio, damage-subroutines in breath(),
prt_level, prt_title.

to do: check out misc3
       count_message isn't implemented

Priest and mage type characters can gain and cast now.  People can browse.
Note: it might be a real good idea to move gain_spells into form_spell.c,
      or otherwise to scope down the globals that those two share.
I am adding examine_book from (missing) dungeon.c to random .c location

.c files that are currently missing in Makefile:
# Missing:  [just-data] (impl-elsewhere) |n/a|
* death dungeon files help (|io|) [monsters] [player] |rnd|
# save scrolls |signals| [tables] [treasure] [variable] |wizard|
